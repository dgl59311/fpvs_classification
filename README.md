- The classification analysis is performed using classification_expt1_et_3.py (multiclass) and classification expt2.py, which read the corresponding .mat files with the data; .py files are saved with the results
- analysis_expt1, 2, and 3, take those .py files and creates .csv files with summary data for each experiment, and also generates single subject figures
- group_level_data_expt1, 2, and 3, loads the .csv summary files and performs the Bayes analysis, and also generates group level figures
- plot_example_data.py generates a figure with data form a few subjects for illustration
